## Description
  
+ This is a splash page about myself that allows employers and clients to view a short bio, projects, and contact information.
+ I designed this HTML to make it simple and clean for people to get in touch with me and stay up to date on projects. 
+ I've learned a lot of front-end fundementals while building this page. Mainly in flexbox, HTML semantics/tags, and CSS properties.
